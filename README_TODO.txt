##TODO's
- Create a GUI method called GameMessage(string message) that outputs any feedback messages to the screen. Simple cout << message.

- Create a Game class method SaveGame(string playerName, double moneyTotal) that writes the name and total to a file inside of a Saved_Games folder.

- Create a Game class method OpenGame(string playerName) that searches the saved_games file for the player name and returns the total money for that player

- for all game functions replace couts with strings that are passed to GameMessage so that all screen output runs through the GUI class.

6. go through code and add any missing validation
7. clean up code by eliminating all DRY portions
